# Project 2
## blah blah blog
* GIVEN there are millions of people in America and the world, trying to process their feelings; a private journal can act as a counterpoint to balance social media outlets.

## Overview

Blah-blah-blog is a virtual journal inspired for those who want to keep their thoughts private, virtually. It is like your own diary that you have at your disposition at any time, as long as you sign-up to have an account. The virtual journal will keep your posts saved and secured.

## Description of the MVP

* WHEN the user signs up, they are presented with a place to title and write a journal entry.
* WHEN the user submits their entry, they can view a dashboard showing the history of their work and thoughts.

## Project Requirements as a Description

### Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
    * Node.js back-end JavaScript runtime environment
        * supports all node modules imported in this app and executes to link with Sequelize to support the blog's Model-View-Controller paradigm.
    * Express.js is a Node.js framework
        * supports routing and middleware functions to link the SQL models with the front end templating tools, handlebars in the blog application.
    
### Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
    * Handlebars inserts Javascript into an HTML environment.
        * The app uses handlebars for all pages. 
        * Creative application was beyond the learning curve time scope of the class activities.

### Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
    * The app relies on MySQL and Sequelize for data and modeling.
    * All team members set up a basic back-end from which to operate.
     

### Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
    * User GET and POST routes are demonstrated.
    * Post GET and POST routes are incorporated.
    * Import and export calls are inconsistent and need additional time to link.   

### Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
    * The app is deployed using Heroku
    * Insomnia could have been used more to set-up users and posts.

### Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.
    * Bulma css framework has been incorporated
    * There are conflicts with the custom css and bulma that need to be resolved (only the custom css done directly to the handlebar system shows)

### Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards:
    * We have tried to implement the following to the best of our ability:
        * file structure
        * naming conventions
        * follows best practices for class/id naming conventions
        * indentations and quality comments

### Have a quality README
    * We have tried to implement the following to the best of our ability:
        * unique description
        * technologies used
        * screenshot, and link to deployed application
